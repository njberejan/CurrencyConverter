# Currency Converter

This repository is for the Currency Converter assignment. It is another early assignment from my first weeks at The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.
The converter allows one to convert an amount of currency from dollars to yen or euros, or any combination of those three currencies.
The user must specify the currency to convert to via the currency symbol. The shortcut to type the euro symbol is alt + shift + 2. The shortcut to type the yen symbol is option + y.
